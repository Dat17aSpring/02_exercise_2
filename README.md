# #2 Exercise 2

In the **exercise_1.html** file you should paste in the text from the **exercise_1.txt** file and add html tags so it will look and "work" like the **exercise_1.pdf** file.

The html tags used in this exercise is:

* h1
* h2
* h3

* p
* br

* img
* a

* b / strong
* i / em

* ol
* ul
* li

A discription of the tags and how to use them can be found at http://www.w3schools.com/html/

Notice that the html tags in the actual text is not shown. You did not learn how to do that, but do you have an idea on how to?     

_NOTE: In order for this to work you will need a method in your controller that returns the string "exercise_1"._
